# WeQuencer

WeQuencer is a multiuser sequencer inspired by [MarcGG's Blog post](http://marcgg.com/blog/2016/11/21/chiptune-sequencer-multiplayer/) and my experience with [Chrome Music Lab's Song Maker.](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/)

My students generally had a lot of fun making music with the Song Maker, so I thought it would be interesting to make it more amenable to sharing.
